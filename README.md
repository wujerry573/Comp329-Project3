Bridge, Observer and Visitor Patterns

Project Description: Demonstrating the implementation of Bridge, Observer and Visitor patterns. 

Bridge Example: Modifying cake orders
- Problem: If a client wants to buy a chocolate cake but modify the size then they could be altering the vanilla cake size as well. 
- Solution: Instead of changing the size of all the cakes for one order the size choice would be decoupled from the flavor of the cake. This allows the client to select different sizes for their cakes independently and later add more choices if they want. 

Observer Example: Website updates for followers

Visitor Example: Displaying various Pizza ingredients
